2007.05.19 - Cleaned up some code.  Added doxygen 'doc' and the HPDC
paper.

2007.04.19 - Fixed vsnprintf warning temporarily.  Removing all hints
from s3asim to get added through a generic hints interface.  Cleaned
up more memory issues.

2007.04.08 - Cleaned up compilation for mpich2-1.0.5p3.  Still one
warning for vsnprintf.  Added new atomicity option and updated PVFS2 hints.

2006.06.30 - Fixed some ^M characters in the src directory.  Fixed the
format of the UPDATES and VERSION file for easier generation of
releases.

2006.04.10 - Changed the noncontiguous parallel writes to use the disp
in MPI_File_set_view to allow larger than 2 GByte files.  However,
within a single I/O call, the last offset must be within 2 GBytes of
the first offset.

2005.09.22 - Fixed a bunch of memory leaks.  Should be memory leak free.

2005.08.31 - Fixed the exiting for no history.  Fixed the histogram
distribution to be pseudo random.

2005.07.21 - We now can use the histogram style size distribution for
both the query sizes and the sequence sizes.

2005.07.20 - Added a README and reorganized source code

2005.07.19 - You can use a db_file to add histogram parameters.  Just
add -b hit.txt where the format of the file is

box_count
range_end   count
range_end   count
...

i.e. 

2
100	123098
200	12

2005.07.06 - s3asim can be verified by running ./run_verify_all.sh.
The entire program should work without any trouble.
